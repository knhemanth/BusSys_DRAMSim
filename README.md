This project is part of a course-work from San Jose State University. The course is CMPE 240 - Advanced computer Design.

This project looks at designing and implementing a Uni-directional bus system with multiple masters and slaves.
Then a Bus interface is designed and implemented for this bus, which interfaces with a DRAM like memory device.
The DRAM memory device is also designed and implemented as a bus slave as part of this project.
